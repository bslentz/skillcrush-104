			<h4>Take a deep breath and dive in.</h4>
			<p>Learning to code can seem overwhelming at first. Especially knowing where and how to begin. The most important thing you can do is stay calm and as difficult as it may be do not give in to the anxiety and fear.</p>

			<p>Fear can be paralyzing and all it will do is crowd your mind with negative thoughts, all of which only hinder your ability to learn how to code.</p>

			<h4>Remind yourself: "I can do this!"</h4>
			<p>Many people have learned to code and been successful. This shows you and can be done and there is no reason why you cannot be included in the many.</p>

			<p>Just know that the process will not be easy and you will get frustrated along the way. However nothing beats the feeling of when you figured out something that has stumped you and you get that "aha" moment when it actually clicks.</p>

			<p>Thing about the end goal and keep your eyes on the prize, the more time and effort you put it in the more reward you will get out.</p>
